    <p>Road accidents are one of the leading causes of fatalities worldwide, and timely detection plays a crucial role in reducing casualties. Traditional accident detection methods rely on human observation or delayed reports, which can lead to slower emergency response times. To address this issue, this project introduces an Accident Detection System using Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

        This system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze video frames from a live feed or a recorded video to detect accidents. The model is trained using accident and non-accident images, enabling it to accurately classify events in real-time. If an accident is detected, the system triggers an alert, such as a beep sound or a message notification, ensuring quick response and assistance.</p>

   <p>The Accident Detection System is designed to identify accidents in real time using deep learning and computer vision. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze video frames from live or recorded footage, accurately classifying accident and non-accident scenarios. The system processes video using OpenCV, enabling smooth detection. When an accident is detected, it triggers a beep sound alert, ensuring immediate awareness. Additionally, it can be integrated with an SMS or notification system to send alerts to emergency contacts or authorities for faster response. This system supports CCTV cameras, dashcams, and traffic surveillance setups, making it highly adaptable. The model is also customizable, allowing further training with new datasets to improve accuracy. By automating accident detection, this system minimizes manual monitoring efforts, enhances emergency response times, and contributes to overall road safety improvement.</p>

    <p>The Accident Detection System is an AI-powered solution that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision to identify road accidents in real-time. It processes video frames from live camera feeds or recorded footage, classifies them as accident or non-accident cases, and triggers an alert when an accident is detected.

        The system is built using TensorFlow for deep learning and OpenCV for video processing. The trained CNN model analyzes each video frame, detects sudden collisions or unusual vehicle movements, and displays the result on the screen. Additionally, the system includes a beep sound alert, which activates immediately upon detecting an accident. To enhance emergency response, the system can also be integrated with an SMS notification feature, allowing it to send alerts to predefined contacts or authorities.
        
        This solution is suitable for traffic surveillance, smart city applications, and vehicle monitoring systems. It can work with CCTV cameras, dashcams, and live video feeds, making it a practical tool for real-world accident detection. The model can also be trained further using a larger dataset to improve accuracy and adapt to different environments. By automating accident detection, the system reduces manual monitoring efforts, ensures faster response times, and significantly enhances road safety and emergency preparedness</p>
